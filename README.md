Data Collection • Play Game to collect data. • Scale data columns for values to be between 0 and 1. • Generate csv file ready for training neural net. • Libraries like Pandas and scikit learn allowed. Testing NN in Game • Reading and preparing inputs in real time • Creating the network architecture when game starts • Loading the trained weights when game starts • Connecting the predictions of the neural network to the game play.
